    abstract = { The purpose of this study was to quantify the elastic properties of tendon structures in vivo and to investigate the influence of the tendon properties on jump performance with and without countermovement. Elongation of the tendon and aponeurosis of vastus lateralis muscle (dL) was directly measured by ultrasonography while subjects (n = 31) performed ramp isometric knee extension up to the voluntary maximum (MVC). The relationship between muscle force and dL was fitted to a linear regression above 50\% MVC, the slope of which was defined as stiffness of the tendon structures. Statistical analysis revealed no significant difference between duplicated measurements of stiffness, with an interday reliability of r = 0.88 and a coefficient of variance of 6.1\%. Although the stiffness was not significantly related to absolute jump height in either vertical jump, it was inversely correlated with the difference in jump height between the vertical jumps performed with and without countermovement. The results suggested that the stiffness of tendon structures has a favorable effect on stretch-shortening cycle exercise, possibly due to adequate storage and recoil of elastic energy. }

 abstract = {Exponential smoothing is a formalization of the familiar learning process, which is a practical basis for statistical forecasting. Higher orders of smoothing are defined by the operator St n(x) =α St n-1(x)+(1- α ) St-1 n(x), where St 0(x) = xt, $0<\alpha <1$. If one assumes that the time series of observations {xt} is of the form xt= nt+Σ i=0 i=N ai ti, where nt is a sample from some error population, then least squares estimates of the coefficients ai can be obtained from linear combinations of the operators S, S2, ⋯ , SN+1. Explicit forms of the forecasting equations are given for N = 0, 1, and 2. This result makes it practical to use higher order polynomials as forecasting models, since the smoothing computations are very simple, and only a minimum of historical statistics need be retained in the file from one forecast to the next.},

  abstract = {Generalization in deep reinforcement learning over unseen environment variations usually requires policy learning over a large set of diverse training variations. We empirically observe that an agent trained on many variations (a generalist) tends to learn faster at the beginning, yet its performance plateaus at a less optimal level for a long time. In contrast, an agent trained only on a few variations (a specialist) can often achieve high returns under a limited computational budget. To have the best of both worlds, we propose a novel generalist-specialist training framework. Specifically, we first train a generalist on all environment variations; when it fails to improve, we launch a large population of specialists with weights cloned from the generalist, each trained to master a selected small subset of variations. We finally resume the training of the generalist with auxiliary rewards induced by demonstrations of all specialists. In particular, we investigate the timing to start specialist training and compare strategies to learn generalists with assistance from specialists. We show that this framework pushes the envelope of policy learning on several challenging and popular benchmarks including Procgen, Meta-World and ManiSkill.},
